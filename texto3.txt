                               GENERAL NOTE

It is safest to rely on works that were published before 1950, except in the 
case of later authors who are explicitly traditional.  In cases of unknown 
authors, consult your traditional priest or confessor for guidance.  Many 
books written after those years are infected with the errors of Modernism or 
of Papolatry (idolatry pertaining to the pope, contrary to the Roman 
Catholic dogma of Vatican Council I) and should be studiously avoided by 
traditional Catholics, as they contain particularly gross errors and even 
deliberate disinformation.  The Warning List below contains some of the most 
virulent examples.

Also, one must be careful of books originally published before Vatican II 
(1962-1965), but "reprinted" afterwards.  Almost always, these are not 
faithful reprints, but "revised" editions not honestly marked as such.  That 
is why we give a prudent rule of thumb:  if a book is "reprinted," it can be 
"revised" or "updated" to post-Conciliar practices and beliefs.  Sometimes 
you can discover this on the reverse title page or in a new preface or in 
the end-matter.  Many times you can't, because the Novus Ordo and Motarian 
presses don't want you to know that they have tampered with the original, 
traditional text.  When these books are re-titled with Novus Ordo 
terminology, such as "Extaordinary Rite" or "Mass of 1962," you can be 
certain that the content has been "revised" to post Vatican II standards.

For example, Canon Francis Ripley's "This is the Faith:  A Complete 
Explanation of the Catholic Faith" was originally published in 1951.  
However, it was "reprinted" with the text being changed to "update" it to 
practices and beliefs after Vatican II.  This is also the case with many 
post-Conciliar editions of the "Baltimore Catechism," the "Catechism of Pope 
Pius X," and other original, traditional books.  Avoid "reprints" and 
instead secure used copies of versions published before 1950.

LEADING MODERNISTS AT THE TIME OF VATICAN II

EWTN CABLE NETWORK
"Cooperates in burying landmarks of the Faith, even as it presents itself as 
a bastion of rock-solid Catholic Tradition, EWTN's mixture of certain 
aspects 
of traditional Roman Catholicism with absolutely appalling novelties 
invented 
during the past 40 years would have reduced the pre-conciliar popes to a 
state of apoplexy" (Ferrara).  Replete with "Charistmatic" hosts and a Novus 
Ordo spin; populated with typically anti-traditional "lay theologians," who 
often express erroneous and unCatholic views; features the Novus Ordo 
counterfeit service with a veneer of Latin.  Mother Angelica, the original 
foundress, has been sidelined for several years by a stroke.


TAN BOOKS
This publisher once purported to publish traditional Catholic books.  
However, it routinely reprints pre-Vatican II books with Novus Ordo 
"updates" in the text, often with no notice at all to the reader.  We have 
found that books from this publisher cannot be trusted to be authentic.  Tan 
has also announced dropping from its catalog some of the most significant 
works of traditional Catholicism because they criticize the invalid Novus 
Ordo Protestantized service, including Cardinals Ottaviani and Bacci's THE 
OTTAVIANI INTERVENTION:  SHORT CRITICAL STUDY OF THE NEW ORDER OF MASS and 
Fr. James Wathen's THE GREAT SACRILEGE.  More recently, it has begun to 
stock the New Order sect's NEW AMERICAN BIBLE, a Modernist paraphrase (not 
even a "translation") of the Bible, which is used in New Order churches.

BIBLE

MODERN SO-CALLED "CATHOLIC" TRANSLATIONS, SUCH AS THE NEW JERUSALEM BIBLE 
AND PARTICULARLY THE NEW AMERICAN BIBLE, WHICH IS THE MODERNIST BIBLE OF THE 
NEW ORDER SECT, ARE DEFINITELY NOT ACCEPTABLE, AS THEY DELIBERATELY 
INTRODUCE INTO THE TRANSLATION MODERNISTIC CONCEPTS AT THE WHIM OF THE 
TRANSLATOR.  MODERN "CATHOLIC" TRANSLATIONS ARE IN FACT NOT TRANSLATIONS AT 
ALL, BUT PARAPHRASES, WHICH ALLOW THE TRANSLATORS TO USE PERSONAL 
CONCEPTIONS OF WHAT THE TEXT MEANS AND TO INJECT THEIR OWN MODERNISTIC 
THEOLOGICAL IDEAS.  THESE "TRANSLATIONS" SHOULD BE AVOIDED BY TRADITIONAL 
CATHOLICS AS LEADING TO PERVERSION OF FAITH.  THEY ARE NOT CATHOLIC, BUT NEW 
ORDER CORRUPTIONS OF SACRED SCRIPTURE.

        THE OFFICIAL CATHOLIC BIBLE:  BIBLIA SACRA IUXTA VULGATAM 
CLEMENTINAM.  This is the only version of Sacred Scripture accepted by the 
Church as being dogmatically error-free.  It is called the Vulgate, 
sometimes the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, after the two popes under whom the 
text was re-edited in Renaissance times.  At the behest of Pope St. Damasus 
I (304-384), St. Jerome (342-420), the scholarly patron saint of 
translators, undertook the task of translation, having not only a command of 
the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues that escapes modern translators but 
also access to manuscripts of the Bible that have long since perished.  1255 
pages (including introductions, indices of key words, Old Testament texts 
found in the New Testament, and maps of the Holy Land, all in Latin), $59.95 
(#B728) from the American Classical League.

        NOVUM TESTAMENTUM VULGATAE EDITIONIS JUXTA PP. CLEMENTIS VIII EDITUM 
/ THE NEW TESTAMENT RHEIMS VERSION REVISED BY BISHOP RICHARD CHALLONER.  The 
Latin Vulgate of the New Testament printed side by side in double columns 
with the Rheims version.  546 pages, c. 2007, hardcover, $39 from Loreto 
Publications.

        THE MOST TRADITIONAL TRANSLATION:  DOUAY-RHEIMS BIBLE.  This is the 
traditional version of St. Jerome's Latin Vulgate in English, the "Catholic 
King James."  It was originally published in 1582/1609 (about the time of 
the King James Bible of 1611, which is substantially based upon it) and 
revised in 1750 by Bishop Challoner.  It is a literal translation of the St. 
Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible, the only official Bible of the Catholic 
Church, and diligently compared with the original Hebrew and Greek.  $39.95 
plus $7.00 shipping from Loreto Publications.

        DOUAY-RHEIMS AUDIO BIBLE.  Available in both MP3 audio format or 
MP3/MP4 audio/visual format, which includes the text that can be read as you 
listen.  Narrated by Steve Webb.  Available as an instant download in 
compressed (ZIP) format (MP3 $21.99, MP4 $24.00) or MP3/MP4 on an 8-GB USB 
memory stick, or on DVD ($22.00).  www.douayrheimsaudiobible.org.

        THE NEXT-BEST TRANSLATION:  THE NEW TESTAMENT - CONFRATERNITY 
VERSION.  A reprint of the Confraternity edition, first published in 1941.  
An update of the Douay-Rheims, upon which it is based, with more modern 
English than that of the 17th century.  Pocket size (8 x 13 cm) with 
ribbon marker, $14.45 from Scepter Publishers.

        ADEQUATE:  THE HOLY BIBLE, REVISED STANDARD EDITION - CATHOLIC 
VERSION.  A modern (1946/1952/1957/1965/1966) literal translation, but 
faithful to the Hebrew and Greek texts rather than to the official Latin 
Vulgate.  N.B.  This is not the New Revised Standard Version, which 
introduces inclusive language and other aberrations.  Compact size (13 x 
21 cm), $34.45 (burgundy or black, leatherbound, gilded edges) or $39.45 
(burgundy or black, indexed) from Scepter Publishers.

	BIBLICAL COMMENTARY:  THE HAYDOCK BIBLE, THE DOUAY-RHEIMS OLD AND NEW 
TESTAMENTS WITH COMMENTARY AND DICTIONARY OF BIBLICAL TERMS AND NAMES.  In 
the 1840s Fr. George Haydock collected extensive commentary from many of the 
Fathers and Doctors of the Church and used them as footnotes to the Douay-
Rheims text.  Leather hardcover with satin ribbon marker, 22 x 28 cm),

HISTORY

        Laux, Fr. John:  CHURCH HISTORY:  A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH IN THE PRESENT DAY.  A concise, clear, traditional history of the 
Catholic Church for the Catholic layman.  The author intersperses the 
history 
with many brief, interesting biographies of famous people, and at the end of 
each chapter, he quotes briefly from a famous writing of the era, blending a 
medley of elements into a comprehensive historical composition that is at 
once 
brilliant and fascinating.  A traditional history of the Church unparalleled 
in its scope, depth, variety, and impact.  Originally a textbook for 
Catholic 
High School students in the 1930s, now this would be at about the upper-
division collegiate level.  1930, 621 pages, Benziger Brothers, available in 
reprint in hardcover, $19.99, from Amazon.com.

        Principe, Lawrence:  SCIENCE AND RELIGION.  This course of twelve 
30-minute lectures presents the most rational summary of the interaction 
between theology and science that we have heard.  The lecturer is a 
professor 
both science and the history of science.  The lectures amply support the 
Catholic Church's historical role as the principal supporter of science 
throughout the ages.  They dispel much of the atheistic and Protestant 
propaganda that the Church is the enemy of science, as the lectures present 
clearly and in detail the overwhelming counter-evidence through copious 
references to the theology of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and other 
Church Fathers.  The lectures demonstrate the traditional relationship of 
science and religion that is too often obscured by the divisive, hot-headed 
rhetoric and the gross oversimplifications we often see in today's 
headlines.  
They treat the current anti-evolution furor, for example, which centers on 
the 
fixation that Genesis I should be taken literally, a view that had been 
rejected by the Fathers of the Church already from St. Augustine on.  Course

LATIN INSTRUCTION BOOKS

        Baumeister, Edmund J.:  THE NEW MISSAL LATIN:  A TWO-YEAR COURSE 
BASED ON THE SUNDAY MISSAL, BOOKS ONE AND TWO.  This is a reprint of a book 
that was originally a high-school text used by the Marianist Fathers in 
their schools in the 1940s.  It is suitable for adult use, but unfortunately 
the authors do not give neither the accentuation or the syllabic quantities 
that would allow one to figure it out.  The vocabulary is based on the 
Sunday Masses in the Missale Romanum, but two-thirds of that vocabulary is 
shared with classical authors like Cicero and Vergil, so those who afterward 
might wish to go on to sample the great works of classical Latin literature 
will not be at a disadvantage.  Book One consists of short lessons, 
vocabulary, exercises, and reading passages.  Book Two is a continuation of 
the Book One set for an advanced study of the Latin of the Roman Missal 
which includes the entire Traditional Latin Mass with full vocabulary on the 
lefthand page and the Latin text on the righthand page.  Supplementary 
manuals, keys, and audiotapes are also available.  408 + 383 pages, 
paperback, $19.95 (Book One), $15.95 (Book Two), plus $3.00 + $1.00 
shipping, from St. Mary's Publishing Co.

        Seidl, Fr. Suitbert H., O.C.D.:  COURSE ON THE LIVING LATIN 
LANGUAGE, 
SECOND EDITION, AMENDED AND ENLARGED.  This course is the fruit of a nearly 
lifetime-long experience in teaching and using Latin as a spoken language.  
It is entirely different from other available instructional materials in 
method and approach to the language.  You learn from the beginning to think 
in Latin and to avoid the usual method of translating by grammatical 
analysis.  Moreover, this course is based on the obvious assumption that 
language is an acoustic phenomenon and has to enter into our mind through 
the 
ears and not through the eyes, and that our memory has to keep the sound of 
the words and not the image of a printed text; therefore, the cassettes 
which 
go with the Cursus are an essential part of this method.  13 audiocassettes, 
$61.00 + $7.05 shipping from Editiones Familiae Sancti Hieronymi.

        Sharpley, G.D.A.:  BEGINNER'S LATIN:  AN EASY INTRODUCTION.  A 
light introduction to Latin, using composed Latin set at a monastery in 
northern Europe around the ninth century.  The grammar is introduced 
gradually, but by the end you should have enough knowledge to understand 
Vulgate Latin fairly well.  A key to the exercises is provided, together 
with 
a Latin-English and English-Latin dictionary.  216 pages, paperback, $11.95, 
from www.amazon.com.

        Sweet, Waldo:  ARTES LATINAE CD-ROM.  For those who prefer a 
spoken approach to learning Latin, the "Sweet" method has been a 
standard approach for many years.  Artes Latinae uses Latin for 
everything:  to define words, explain structures, ask questions, 
describe pictures, interpret stories, and talk to people.  This CD-ROM 
contains the course as spoken in the Ecclesiastical (Italianate) 
pronunciation, as well as the American Scholastic (as used in most 
schools) and the Restored Classical (a more accurate version of the 
Scholastic).  Package (manual, graded reader, reference notebook, unit test 
book, and unit test guide) for Levels I $99.00, Level II $111.00, Level III 
$88.00 from Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers.

        Wheelock, Frederick M. (Richard A. LeFleur, ed.):  WHEELOCK'S 
LATIN, 7TH EDITION.  This the standard college text for classical Latin, 
consisting of 40 chapters with grammatical explanations and readings based 
on 
ancient Roman authors.  It is well suited for self-study, with exercises, an 
answer key, and an English-Latin/Latin-English vocabulary.  Assumes some 
familiarity with grammatical concepts and terms.  2011, 608 pages, 
paperback, 
$14.15, from HarperCollins Publishers, 10 East 53rd St., New York, NY 10022, 
ISBN 0-06-199722-6.

ROSARY

        ROSARIUM (THE ROSARY).  This compact disc contains all fifteen 
decades of the Most Holy Rosary, with opening and closing prayers, all 
prayed in Latin.  It concludes with the Angelus, also prayed in Latin.  Many 
traditional Catholics are finding that praying the Most Holy Rosary in the 
Church's sacred languages brings a depth of understanding that repetition 
in the common vernacular does not afford.  The recitation of the Angelus 
once 
a day, or better thrice a day at morning, noon, and evening, is a simple 
traditional devotion that should be taken up actively by traditional 
Catholics.  St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary Tapes.

        Coomaraswamy, Dr. Rama:  THE PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW MASS:  A BRIEF 
OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR THEOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN THE NOVUS ORDO 
MISSAE.  Dr. Coomaraswamy concisely explains why the "New Mass" of 1969 is 
actually an invalid Protestantized worship service intended by the Newchurch 
of the New Order to replace the Traditional Latin Mass considered by Popes 
and Councils for two thousand years to be essentially unchangeable.  He 
clearly explains what has been deleted and how the "New Mass" has been 
Protestantized and invalidated.  1990, 86 pages, paperback, $7.00 from CMRI.

APART FROM THE NEW MASS.  In his sequel to THE PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW MASS, 
Dr. Coomaraswamy exposes the defects in the sacraments of the Newchurch of 
the New Order.  He exposes the planned self-destruction of the Church, as 
designed and executed by the New Order clergy and their subtle plan to 
destroy the Catholic Church as traditionally understood by destroying the 
traditional Sacraments.  He documents the specific changes made to the 
traditional Sacraments other than the Mass by Newchurch that Protestantized 
and invalidated them.  2010, 292 pages, paperback, $19.95 from Amazon.com.

Marian Therese Horvat:  WE RESIST YOU TO THE FACE.  Analyzes the 
consequences of the adaptation of the Church to the modern world and the 
consequences of ecumenism, as applied since Vatican II.  The authors declare 
themselves in a state of resistance relative to the teachings of Vatican 
Council II, Popes John XXIII and Paul VI, and to the teachings of John Paul 
II that are objectively opposed to the prior ordinary and extraordinary 
papal 
magisterium."  The authors affirm that this position implies the desire 
neither to judge the pope nor to declare the Apostolic See vacant.  They 
base 
their act on Doctors of the Church, among them, St. Thomas Aquinas and St. 
Robert Bellarmine.  $13.00 + $3.00 shipping from Tradition in Action.

NEW PAPACY.  Practically 500 photographs of what has happened to the papacy 
since Vatican II:  awash in a sea of semi-nudity, engaging in paganistic 
dance, abandoning the unmistakable symbols of the papacy, schmoozing, often 
in a religious context, with heretics, schismatics, Protestants, Jews, 
Muslims, Buddhists, Hinduists, and, yes, even Voodoists.  There is little 
explanatory text; the photographs speak for themselves.  $13.00 + $3.00 
shipping from Tradition in Action.

GUIDE TO THE TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC MOVEMENT.  This book describes how the

        Trinchard, Fr. Paul:  "NEW MASS" CONCLUSIVELY INVALID, ACCORDING TO 
THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE.  This book presents the theological evidence 
that the "New Mass" is conclusively invalid, using the principles from 
Apostolic Tradition reiterated in Apostolicae Curae by Pope Leo XIII 
declaring the Anglican "New Mass" invalid.  Ordained a Jesuit priest and 
having received his Pontifical Licentiate in Sacred Theology (S.T.L.) just 
before the institution of the "New Mass," the author celebrated the "New 
Mass" all the days of his priesthood.  After his retirement as a diocesan 
priest, he undertook a fifteen-year research and study of the "New Mass" 
versus the canonized Traditional Latin Mass and determined that on the basis 
of Roman Catholic theology, particularly Pope Leo XIII's Bull "Apostolicae 
Curae," which declared the Anglican service invalid after 300 years, Fr. 
Trinchard was shocked to discover that the "New Mass" is conclusively 
invalid.  In this book he presents the evidence of his research and study on 
the question.  Paperback, 2004, $16.00 + $6.00 postage and handling from 
MAETA.  252 pages, paperback, $16.00 from MAETA.

        Wathen, Fr. James:  THE GREAT SACRILEGE (1971).  Fr. Wathen's 
treatment of the Novus Ordo service shortly after it was imposed was a

illegal, immoral, not Catholic, and actually null and void.  181 pages, 
paperback, available from used-book sources only.
